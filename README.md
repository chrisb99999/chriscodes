# chriscodes
An example live resume page, based on Josh Comeau and Julia Johnson (www.juliacodes.com). The intention is to first create a clone, then create a novel version.

### Process

First, reviewing Julia's site shows it is built out on Gatsby, so I'm going to use this as an attempt to learn some Gatsby as we go. I'll also be looking to pull in some Greensock and an SVG mask section as I move to the novel version.
